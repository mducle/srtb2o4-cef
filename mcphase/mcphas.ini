[MCPHASE RUNTIME CONTROL]

# to stop program set exit to 1
exit=0

# to hold program set pause to 1
pause=0

# to display all structures while iterating set displayall to 1
# (mind that by using this option mcphas gets very slow)

# to create a logfile of the propagation versus free energy  set logfevsQ to 1
# (mind this uses a lot of disc space)

xHc=0

# range of x
xmin=0.1
xmax=0.1
